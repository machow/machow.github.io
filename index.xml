      <description>.tabs__link--active { background-color: #eee; } .tabs ul { align-items: baseline; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; }  Imagine you had to implement a standard action across 60 packages.
For example,
 Jupyter notebooks needs represent python classes as custom html. The broom package in R uses its tidy() function to create summaries of many statistical models.  In this post I will discuss two approaches they could take to do this.</description>

      <title>Using R and the A* Algorithm: Animated Pathfinding with gganimate</title>

      <description>This post is the second part of a series on using the A* algorithm in R.
While my previous post introduced the machow/astar-r library, and how it works, in this one I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on visualizing it finding a solution with gganimate. Below is an outline of what I&amp;rsquo;ll cover.
 manually define a maze and plot it with ggplot use an example class from the astar library to navigate it add a bonus picture of a gnome to the maze use a single line of gganimate to animate the A* search  Drawing the maze First, we&amp;rsquo;ll load in the necessary libraries, and create a simple maze to navigate.</description>

      <title>Using R and the A* Algorithm: Turning Cats into Dogs</title>

      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve come across a 3 problems that were solved quickly using the A* algorithm:
 Splitting cantonese sentences into words (e.g. 我好肚餓 -&amp;gt; 我 - 好 - 肚餓). Comparing how similar sounding two english words are. Cruising around minecraft.  Since I started on these problems using python, the python-astar package got me up and running quickly. However, when switching to R I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find it in any libraries, like igraph.</description>

      <description>Over the past year I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on the tools to execute and grade code behind the scenes at DataCamp. This work has ranged from expanding our open source tools for grading R and Python code, to running SQL and bash exercises. However, while helping scale up education data science education to thousands of students is something I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to do since helping teach statistics in grad school, there&amp;rsquo;s is a certain sanity in being in a room with handful of students.</description>
