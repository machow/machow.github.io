      <title>Using R and the A* Algorithm: Turning Cats into Dogs</title>

      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve come across a 3 problems that were solved quickly using the A* algorithm:
 Splitting cantonese sentences into words (e.g. 我好肚餓 -&amp;gt; 我 - 好 - 肚餓). Comparing how similar sounding two english words are. Cruising around minecraft.  Since I started on these problems using python, the python-astar package got me up and running quickly. However, when switching to R I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find it in any libraries, like igraph.</description>

      <title>Teaching Data Science to High Schoolers</title>

      <description>Over the past year I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on the tools to execute and grade code behind the scenes at DataCamp. This work has ranged from expanding our open source tools for grading R and Python code, to running SQL and bash exercises. However, while helping scale up education data science education to thousands of students is something I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to do since helping teach statistics in grad school, there&amp;rsquo;s is a certain sanity in being in a room with handful of students.</description>
